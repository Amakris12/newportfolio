       <p>I currently have only have had one job in my life and its where i currently work. The job is at the Panera Bread on happy valley and the I17. What 
           do there depends because I've done multiple jobs. I can be a dining room attendent, dishwasher, and I am currently being trained as a cashier. These jobs
           helped a lot with people skills and it also taught me that I have to do a good job on anything I do.

    <h1 id="hid2">Community Servcie</h1>
    <div id="divcom">
        <br>
        <p>Some community service I have particpated in over the years have been strecthed from saint marys food bank to helping set up a marathon at 4 in the morning.
            Community service has taught me a lot when it comes to how the world actually is. When I helped out at saint marrys food bank they showed us a video and it 
            really put a persective on how lucky I am in life and how I can help the world by doing this simple task for a few hours.
